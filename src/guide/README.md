# Introduction

In this introduction, I will explain in a few words why and how I came to make an ftp server with Deno.

First of all, I needed an ftp server with which I could use a MongoDB database, I don’t know if it’s a good or a bad idea and I admit that I got used to working with MongoDB and that for the moment I will not change for anything in the world.

Since I was basically doing it for myself, I thought it would be a good idea to share it, that’s why today you have the possibility to either follow the installation of the software and use it as is, or use the Deno module to make your own ftp server software.

For my part I use the software with a MongoDB database but I thought about SQL database users, the software supports Maria, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite databases.

If you want to know more about the software all the information this located in [Software Setup](./soft-setup)

And if you want to know more about the Deno module all the information that is in [Mod Setup](./mod-setup)
